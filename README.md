# Spam Email Detector

This project focuses on developing a spam email detection system using machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to build a model capable of classifying emails into spam and non-spam (ham) categories based on their content. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.

## Introduction

Spam emails, or junk mail, pose a significant challenge in email communication. This project aims to address this issue by implementing a machine learning-based spam email detector. The detector is trained on a dataset containing information about advertising expenditures on different platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the corresponding sales amounts. The model is developed using the scikit-learn library in Python.

## Features

- **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaning and organizing the dataset, handling missing values, and converting text data into numerical values.
  
- **Model Training:** Utilizing Logistic Regression for training the machine learning model on the pre-processed data.
  
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy on both training and test datasets.
  
- **Predictive System:** Demonstrating how to use the trained model to predict whether a new email is spam or non-spam.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-detector.git
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project. The notebook/script is well-commented to guide you through each phase of the project.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about advertising expenditures on different platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the corresponding sales amounts. The data is stored in a CSV file (`spam.csv`).

## Data Pre-processing

The data pre-processing steps involve handling missing values, converting categorical labels into numerical ones, and transforming text data into feature vectors.

## Training the Model

The machine learning model is trained using Logistic Regression. The notebook/script provides details on how the model is trained and includes the accuracy scores on both training and test datasets.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can be considered for a more comprehensive evaluation.

## Predictive System

A section is dedicated to showcasing how the trained model can be used to predict whether a new email is spam or non-spam.
